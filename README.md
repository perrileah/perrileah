# Hi, I'm Leah! ğŸ‘‹

I have been a fundraiser and communications professional in the nonprofit sector for the past 5 years. Looking for a new career path that would challenge me every day, I have found the perfect path with web development! 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building an e-commerce store in Ruby on Rails
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about SQL.
